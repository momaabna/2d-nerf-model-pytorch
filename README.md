# 2d-nerf-model-pytorch

# Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a 2D NERF (Neural Radiance Fields) model for image rendering using PyTorch in a Jupyter Notebook format. The model is designed to render images using a 9-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and sinusoidal position encoding (PE).

# Model Configuration
The model is configured with adjustable hyperparameters in the second cell:



Requirements
PyTorch >= 1.7

# Getting Started

Open the Jupyter Notebook 2d-nerf-model-implementation.ipynb and follow the instructions to train the model on your own dataset.
